#+Title: cfengine-lynis

CFEngine policy to automate the installation, running, and reporting of [[https://cisofy.com/lynis/][CISOfy's
lynis]] system audits.


* Installation

From the root of a repository clone ~make install~.

The policy will be installed into =services/cfengine-lynis=.

Ensure the policy is included in inputs. For example, it can be included via
augments if you are running the MPF:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
  {
    "inputs" : [ "services/cfengine-lynis/main.cf" ]
  }
#+END_SRC

Ensure the policy actuated.

If the class =services_autorun= is defined and you are running the MPF it will
be automatically actuated.

It can be appended to the main =bundlesequence= via augments if you are running
the MPF:

#+BEGIN_SRC json
  {
    "vars" : {
      "control_common_bundlesequence_end": [ "lynis:main" ]
    }
  }
#+END_SRC

Or you can actuate it with a =methods= promise from your existing policy.

#+BEGIN_SRC cfengine3
  bundle agent example
  {
      methods:
        "CISOfy Lynis"
          usebundle => lynis:main;
  }
#+END_SRC

When the policy is run with the =inform_mode= class defined it will report the
findings.
